Idea: Can a songs danceability be determined based on it's popularity.

Data Sources:

1. https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks
2. https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017

Admittedly, my original idea was to 'predict' through a ML model a songs popularity based on features like danceability, energy, liveness, etc.
These features are tagged by Spotify and are given to songs as far back as 1928.

This project turned out to be a larger learning experience than I expected. Using the data sets I was only able to match 79 songs. In theory, I
should have roughly 52 songs per year from 1958 to 2017. More exploration and time is needed in this area.

Future work could include building a model of all songs in the Spotify dataset merged with the Billboard ratings to determine popularity.
Ideally, this model could predict how well a song would perform given accurate features.

Based on what is compiled and currently displayed, there does seem to be a trend upwards of danceability in the past two decades.
